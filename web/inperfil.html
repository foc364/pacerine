      <p>        I have graduated with an honors degree in Architecture and Urbanism, from the Mackenzie Presbyterian University in Sao Paulo. I have also completed a master in Building  technology from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia in Barcelona .
I am looking to gain more practical and theoretical experience within this sector. I am interested in all aspects from Design and Implementation to the ongoing maintenance of construction projects.
 
        <br />
        <br />
        I have experience gained both at University as well as externally in developing and implementing small, medium and large scale construction designs relating to housing, hotels, banks, commercial and institutional buildings (as well as other related projects).

        <br />
        <br />
        I have extensive experience using the following graphic design software; Autocad 2D & 3D, Photoshop, 3D Studio Max, Sketchup, Revit and Microsoft Office Applications.I have been lucky enough to work alongside some seasoned professionals whilst completing projects for Caixa Econ√¥mica Federal, Santander, Accor Hotels, The Heritage Foundation of the Energy and Sanitation of Sao Paulo; which consists of Sabesp, CESP, Electropaulo and Comgas, companies that supply energy for almost whole state of Sao Paulo. This experience coupled with my knowledge of design and implementation has given me a good all round understanding of how to design and more importantly, deliver; successful , creative and innovative projects.

        <br />
        <br />
        Also I worked on a self-employed basis. One of my contracts was to oversee the construction and expansion of some residential areas, working alongside with a Civil Engineer, we designed all structural systems; including plumbing, electricity, coatings, roofing and interior design. I was also heavily involved in a many bank agencies projects and commercial ones, where I designed a public house, developing furniture to scale rooms of residence.

        <br />
        <br />
        Kind regards
        <br />
        <br />
